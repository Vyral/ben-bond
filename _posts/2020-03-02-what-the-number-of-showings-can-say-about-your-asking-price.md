If you’re a home seller in the Kansas City market, it’s **possible to get showings the same day you list your home for sale**, depending on whether you’re in the city or the suburbs.

Being in a seller’s market, inventory is very low at the moment. Even though buyers don’t have as much to choose from, you still need to price your home correctly the first time you list—today’s buyers can spot an overpriced home, and the number of listings you get will suffer if you deviate from your home’s market value.

If your home has been on the market for a month, you should expect, at minimum, 10 showings and at least one offer. **If you don’t get that many listings or any offers after a month on the market, your home is definitely priced too high** and you should speak to your real estate professional about a price correction.&nbsp;

As your real estate agent, my goal is to get you the most money possible as quickly as possible without leaving any money on the table. If you’re in the market to sell your home, give me a call or send an email. I’ll help you accurately gauge your home price for the market and guide you through the showing process as buyers discover your listing. I hope to hear from you soon\!
