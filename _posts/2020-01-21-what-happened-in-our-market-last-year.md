**If you’re thinking of buying or selling in 2020, these new statistics from the Kansas City Regional Association of Realtors are important to know.**

Home prices went up again in 2019 here in Kansas City. Closed sales also went up 16.5% for existing homes and 13.7% for new homes, while inventory decreased by 21.3% for existing homes and 14.2% for new homes.

What does this mean to you? Demand is high and inventory is low, so we’re still in a seller’s market. We have a two-month supply of inventory, meaning that if no new homes were built or listed for sale, all of our homes would be sold in two months. Anything under six months is a seller’s market.

With low mortgage rates, low unemployment, and continued wage growth, **homebuyer activity is expected to remain healthy in 2020.** New construction continues to be on the rise, but many of the experts note that the country is still not building enough new units to quench that demand.

It remains to be seen whether existing homeowners will be enticed to sell their homes for higher prices, which could finally bring the overall housing market into a greater balance. **Our average home price right now is $251,000, and the average days on market for all home types is just 39 days.** The average list-to-sale price ratio is 96.6%.

If you want to know about what those stats look like for our team or if you have any questions about real estate, feel free to reach out via phone or email anytime. I look forward to hearing from you.
